# TIMS Rest Client

  	TCPWave provides an extremely powerful Rest API to simplify any and every trivial task in IP Address management.
  	An authorization token is generated for each user and can be only used from the source IP from which the API is invoked.
  	Another way is to use appliance and client certificates to invoke REST calls and establish communication with IPAM.
  
  	In order for the update to take place via the API, the appropriate user should also have permissions to perform the desired action.
  	This API call allows the user with the appropriate privileges to add a resource to the TCPWave IPAM.
  	Execution of this REST call is audited by the TCPWave IPAM. Customers are advised to execute this REST API call in a
    non-production environment before attempting to execute it in a production environment.
